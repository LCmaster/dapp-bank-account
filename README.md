# Shared Accounts DAPP

A simple DApp project where the user can create up to 3 shared accounts.

Each member (aka owner) of the account can deposit funds in it or request for withdrawal.

Each withdrawal request must be approved by all other members (aka owners) before the author of the request can withdraw the requested amount from the account.

A test version was deployed to the Sepolia testnet.
